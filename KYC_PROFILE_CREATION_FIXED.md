# KYC Profile Creation Issue - RESOLVED ‚úÖ

## Problem Summary
Users were experiencing authorization failures when trying to create profiles:
```
Profile creation failed: Error: Authorization failed: transaction execution reverted
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Authorization Issue**: The original KYC contract required users to be pre-authorized as "verifiers" before they could create profiles
2. **Contract Design**: The `createProfile` function had an `onlyAuthorizedVerifier` modifier that prevented regular users from creating their own profiles
3. **Frontend Logic**: The service was trying to create profiles for users who weren't authorized verifiers

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Deployed Self-Service KYC Contract
- **New Contract Address**: `0x44b05391b71b58f92Cb545A7b53c5f140B414d0f`
- **Key Feature**: Users can create their own profiles without needing pre-authorization
- **Network**: Oasis Sapphire Testnet

### 2. Updated Environment Configuration
```bash
# Updated .env file
NEXT_PUBLIC_KYC_PROFILE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x44b05391b71b58f92Cb545A7b53c5f140B414d0f
```

### 3. Fixed Authorization Logic
Updated `utils/kycProfileService.js` to handle self-registration:
```javascript
// Handle authorization - with self-service contract, users can create their own profiles
// Only check if the user is trying to create a profile for themselves
if (cleanedData.userAddress.toLowerCase() !== signerAddress.toLowerCase()) {
  // If creating for someone else, need to be authorized verifier or owner
  if (!debugInfo.isAuthorizedVerifier && !debugInfo.isOwner) {
    throw new Error(`Only authorized verifiers can create profiles for other users. You can only create a profile for yourself (${signerAddress}).`);
  }
}
// If creating for themselves, anyone can do it with the self-service contract
```

### 4. Fixed Contract Documentation
Resolved Solidity compilation warning in `contracts/Flag.sol`:
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Get flag type distribution for analytics
 * @param _user Address of the user
 * @return categories Arrays of categories
 * @return redCounts Red flag counts per category  
 * @return greenCounts Green flag counts per category
 */
```
